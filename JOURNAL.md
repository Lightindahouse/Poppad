This is popbytes! Im working on a macropad with seven keys. Oled screen, and a knob. I chose this to be my first solo project so I can learn more. This is my first time writing a journal so I apologize if Its not proper. The first hour I will be setting up everything I need and settling on my ideas so I can start. I am following the hackpad guide but I will ofc customize it not copy paste that lol.

Finihed designing the pcb, revising all my steps and doing some touches.

OKayyy so after running design rules checker, found 7 errors lets fix

fixed all errors. PCB done.

Nowww time for the case.

found out I messed up wiring, back to pcb

forgot to edit journal but finalized everything with pcb, working on case now

okayy all parts of case done now time to check everything before i ship, gnona fix if i find anything. Im pretty sure i didn't journal well, but we all start somewhere!
