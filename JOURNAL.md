This is popbytes! Im working on a macropad with seven keys. Oled screen, and a knob. I chose this to be my first solo project so I can learn more. This is my first time writing a journal so I apologize if Its not proper.
The first hour I will be setting up everything I need and settling on my ideas so I can start. I am following the hackpad guide but I will ofc customize it not copy paste that lol. 

Finihed designing the pcb, revising all my steps and doing some touches.

OKayyy so after running design rules checker, found 7 errors lets fix
