# 4-Key Macropad with a Knob

A custom macropad I made with 4 keys, a knob, and RGB lights. I designed the PCB in KiCad and made the case in Fusion 360.

I wanted to strengthen my skills in kicad and fusion, as I am used to getting carried at these parts.

## Features
- 4 style mechanical switches  
- 1 rotary encoder 
- 2 RGB LED 
- RP2040 microcontroller  
- Custom case




## How to Build
1. Solder the RP2040, encoder, LEDs, and switches to the PCB.  
2. Flash the firmware of choice. 
3. 3D print the case.
4. put them all together.
5. boom!
